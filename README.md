# Sample Repo
This is a sample of the repository you will create in this orginization. Your repository should be named firstname_lastname so that I can identify it as yours. It should have a directory for assignments and a directory for project 0. This is the location where I will look for project 0 and for assignments I will be grading.  
  
You should clone the repo to your local machine and work on projects/assignments within the repo directory. Make a habit of frequently commiting and pushing up to the repo so you can track and recover your work.  
  
I will only accept work merged into the main branch, but you should feel free to create and utilize multiple branches. Just make sure to merge your work into main when it's done.  
  
Git won't track empty folders, which is why the folders have a readme file in them. You can also create a readme file in order to make sure git tracks the assignment and project folders.
  
You will have 4 projects in total, 0-3. Only project 0 will be submitted here. Projects 1, 2, and 3 are group projects and your groups will create other repos in this orginization to track, collaborate, and submit.
